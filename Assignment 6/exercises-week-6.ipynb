    "The largest anthropogenic sources of methane are agriculture, fossil fuels, and decomposition of landfill waste (see [Methane Basics](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/methane/#:~:text=Methane%20Basics&text=and%20human%20activities.-,An%20estimated%2060%25%20of%20today%27s%20methane%20emissions%20are%20the%20result,being%20the%20largest%20natural%20source.)). In this exercise, we will build on the work you did in exercise 3 to predict methane emissions in urban areas. We assume that large urban areas contain both industrial sites and landfills. Agriculture will not be explicitly considered in this exercise, but you can incorporate it in the model, if you want.\n",
